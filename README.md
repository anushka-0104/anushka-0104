# Hi, I’m Anushka 👋  

I’m a postgraduate Software Engineering student at Heriot-Watt University, currently building strong foundations in **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**.

I enjoy working with data — cleaning messy datasets, exploring patterns, asking better questions, and turning raw numbers into insights that make sense.

I’m working toward graduate-level Data Analyst roles where I can combine technical skills with structured thinking.

## 📊 What I Focus On

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical thinking  
- Data visualization  
- Writing clear, readable analysis code  
- Explaining insights in simple language  

I believe good analysis is not about complex models — it’s about clarity, logic, and interpretation.

## 📁 What You’ll Find on My GitHub

- Coursework-based data projects  
- Refactored beginner-friendly analysis projects  
- Exploratory notebooks  
- Cleaned datasets with documented steps  
- Small experiments to understand concepts properly  

I prefer keeping projects simple and readable instead of overly engineered.

## 📈 My Approach to Data

1. Understand the problem  
2. Clean and validate the dataset  
3. Explore patterns and relationships  
4. Visualize findings  
5. Interpret results in context  

For me, analysis isn’t just about running code — it’s about asking:
“What is this data really telling me?”
